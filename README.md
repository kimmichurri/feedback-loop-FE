# Turing Feedback

Turing Feedback was created as a capstone project at [The Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/), where learning to give and receive feedback is a critical part of the curriculum. 

This application allows instructors to create surveys for students in any active cohort, drag and drop students into teams, post surveys for students to give their teammates feedback, and see results from those surveys on their dashboard. Students will receive an email telling them they've been asked to complete a survey and can log in to their account to see their teammates, complete feedback, and see the feedback they've received.

## Future Iterations

- Incorporate Oauth to allow users to log in with GitHub
- Allow surveys to include an option to submit commits
- Provide more robust feedback data and data visualization, so both instructors and students can better track results over time.
- Add a step allowing instructors to review students' feedback before sharing with the recipient.
